# **Analysis of Sorting Algorithms**

A python program to analyze the Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms

> ## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble
- Selection
- Insertion
- Radix
- Heap
- Quick
- Merge

> ## Analysis Process

1. Generating Random Arrays of different Sizes
2. Running the sorting algrithms on the generated arrays and get the runtime
3. Export the Test data as csv, xlsx, html or json
4. Visualize the Test data

> ### Methods

- Test can be performed on sorted, unsorted or both
- Visualization can be done with a line plot or scatter plot
